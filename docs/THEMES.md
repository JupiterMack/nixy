# Themes

Themes are defined in `hosts/themes`. Those themes define the colors, fonts, icons, etc, used by Hyprland and the apps installed.
You can change the selected theme by changing the import statement at the top of your host's variables file.

*To apply the theme to duckduckgo, follow the instructions in `$HOME/.duckduckgo-colorscheme.js`.*

## Create your own theme

Create a copy of one of the existing theme and change the variables.
Wallpapers are loaded from the `home/wallpapers` folder.
